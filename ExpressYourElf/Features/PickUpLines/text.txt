Pre; Hey <target>, baby.

Can I set my Heartstone at your place tonight?'
Was your father a rogue? ‘Cause someone stole the stars from the sky and put them in your eyes.
Hey, Baby! Anybody ever tell you I have beautiful eyes?
My name is <name>> - a <Sex;Man|Woman> of the Universe. A popular <girl|boy> like you is going to need some wooing
Enough about you, let's talk about me, <name>.
I seem to have lost my Heartstone. Can I have yours?
They say the Darkmoon Faire is the happiest place on earth. Well apparently, no one has ever been standing next to you.
I’m not a black smith, but I can melt me and you together.
Is there an Flight master nearby or is it my heart taking off?
Do you play Heartstone? I can show you my deck.
That tabard looks great on you… as a matter of fact, so would I.
you’re so hot, you make the Tanaris look like the Northrend.
